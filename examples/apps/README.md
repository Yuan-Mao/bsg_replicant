# Apps

This directory contains HammerBlade applications that are too complex
or too large to fit into a regression flow. This can be for a variety
of reasons: additional submodules, packages, datasets, or some
combination of the three.

Unlike the cuda examples, these are apps that test/demonstrate more
than one feature. While we will make every effort to ensure that they
are bug-free and up-to-date, they take lower priority than the typical
regression suite that we run.
